<h2><a name="THE_LAKE_OF_GENEVA" id="THE_LAKE_OF_GENEVA">THE LAKE OF GENEVA</a></h2>


<h3 id="Sec_I">I.</h3>

<p>Whether you feel sympathy, or not, with
Calvin, the theologian, who gave us, at not more
than twenty-eight years of age, the epoch-making
Christian Institutes, or with Calvin, the
inflexible governor, who helped to put to death
poor Michael Servetus outside the city wall of
Geneva, on the garden slopes of Champel, you
can hardly fail to realize at least some transient
flicker of interest when you contemplate, beneath
its solitary fir-tree, and hard by a clump of box,
the small, white, oblong stone&mdash;it is less than a
foot long, and marked simply with the initials
J. C.&mdash;that is supposed to mark the grave, in
the old crowded cemetery near the Plaine du
Plainpalais, of Jean Calvin, the politician and
man. The cemetery itself is a little hard to
find, for it lies hidden away in a commonplace
back-quarter of the city, in a part that is far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
removed from all that is brightest, and most
cosmopolitan, and therefore most familiar, in
Geneva. Nor, even when you find it, is this
grave of Calvin obvious, lost, as it is, amongst a
thousand other tombs which rise in some disorder
from amidst an inextricable tangle of
daisies and long rank grass, of lady's-smock and
dandelions. As happens almost always in old
burial-grounds in Scotland, there is here an
eloquent lack of Christian symbols: Catholics
are buried here as well as Protestants, but the
spirit of iconoclasm is none the less supreme&mdash;plenty
of broken columns, of import purely Pagan,
but never, I think, the Cross, lest it savour of
superstition. This, too, was Wordsworth's experience
in the burial-ground at Dumfries:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"'Mid crowded obelisks and urns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sought the untimely grave of Burns."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Yet here, in this half-forgotten old graveyard,
where Calvin was laid to rest when not quite
fifty-five years of age, at least there is none of that
nightmare horror that broods over Knox's cenotaph
in the Necropolis at Glasgow. Calvin and
Knox! We group the two in fancy when we
stand here in this silent spot, on the edge of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
same Geneva&mdash;how transfigured to-day in outward
aspect not less than in mental outlook!&mdash;where
Knox once ministered for more than a year
in the little church of the Auditoire, and where
Calvin once ruled with a rod of iron. At any
rate this sombre old burial-ground, when so much
else in the Geneva of to-day is almost aggressively
gay and modern, is surely not unfitted for
the last repose of a spirit so austere, and of logic
so relentless. And this is what is written above
the entrance: "Heureux ceux qui meurent au
Seigneur. Ils reposent de leurs travaux et leurs
œuvres les suivent."</p>

<p>Calvin, indeed, is inseparably connected with
the greatest moment in Geneva's history. His
rule for nearly a quarter of a century of this
little city state is chosen by Lord Morley in his
Romanes lecture at Oxford in 1897 as an outstanding
illustration of what can be accomplished
by moral forces in the absence of giant armies
and big guns. It is impossible, in fact, to think
of historical Geneva without thinking of Calvin,
though Calvin himself was by birth a Frenchman,
and hailed from the sleepy little city of
Noyon (the German guns have spared it), in the
department of the Aisne. Rousseau, on the
other hand, though Genevese by birth, seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
belong more properly to the French Revolution,
and to France. The tall, white tenement where
the future author of the "Contrât Social" lived
as a child may still be seen in the St. Gervais
quarter, on the right bank of the river, at the
junction, if I recollect rightly, of the present Rue
Rousseau with the Place de Chevelu, in close
proximity to a modiste's establishment and to a
shop for the sale of fishing-tackle, and virtually,
if not wholly, within sight and hearing of the
music and blue swiftness of the Rhone. Actually,
however, he was born in his maternal grandfather's
house, which has since been pulled down, in the
Grande Rue, towards the summit of the hill that
is crowned by the Cathedral, in the high-town
of Geneva. The old workman's quarter of St.
Gervais is perhaps seldom visited by Englishmen,
though everybody skirts it, perhaps half-a-dozen
times a day, as they traverse the very modern Rue
du Mont Blanc on their way to the main railway
station, or to the splendid new Hôtel-des-Postes.
Yet its eighteenth-century streets&mdash;this is possibly
their date&mdash;are at least as full of interest, and
are certainly far more typical, than the Parisian-like
blocks of new houses that front the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
quays. If you want to realize the aspect of old
Geneva properly, before the advent of the railway
and the hordes of modern trippers, you
should study the curious model now preserved in
the splendid new Musée d'Art et d'Histoire, in
the Rue des Casemates. Then it had no front,
in the ordinary sense, towards the lake; and the
islands in the Rhone were laden with quaint old
tenements. Moreover, the whole city was then
surrounded by a ring of many-angled fortifications
in the familiar manner of Vauban.</p>

<div id="ip_9" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i_011.jpg" width="600" height="493" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE JURA RANGE FROM THONON, HTE. SAVOIE.</div></div>

<p>If the actual birth-place of Jean Jacques Rousseau
in the Grande Rue has perished, no better
piece of luck has befallen the house, at No. 11,
Rue des Chanoines (now relabelled Rue Calvin),
in which Calvin, as recorded by an existing tablet,
resided from 1543 to his death in 1564. To find
authentic associations with Calvin we must pass
into the former Cathedral, now the Protestant
Church of St. Pierre, where is still preserved a
chair on which he is said to have sat to preach.
The Cathedral itself, however, is his truest monument,
for in this he constantly preached, and in
this he delivered judgment. This last is a grand
old Romanesque pile, with transeptal towers like
those at Exeter; but sadly disfigured externally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
by an atrocious, Classical, eighteenth-century west
front. This, with its Corinthian pillars, might be
well enough elsewhere, but is quite out of keeping,
like the west front at Fécamp, in Normandy,
with the older work behind. It must also be
acknowledged that here, as at Lausanne, the
austere Calvinistic furniture is wholly out of
keeping with an interior that was obviously intended
for elaborate Catholic ritual. In a very
odd position, at the south-west corner of the
nave, is the striking fifteenth-century Chapel of
the Maccabées that was built in 1406 by Cardinal
Jean de Brogny, who was Bishop of Geneva between
1423 and 1426. The curious name is met
with again as far away as Amiens, and may
possibly derive from "macabre," the Chapel of
the Dead: Brogny, indeed, is said to have built
this chapel with a view to his own future interment.
In the body of the church there are really
several points to notice, though at first its general
aspect is repellently cold and bare. In the chancel
and south nave aisle remain a number of old stalls
with misericordes, one of the last of which is unexpectedly
carved with a frog. Other stalls have
canopies, apparently much restored, the backs of
which are sculptured with figures of Prophets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Apostles, greatly recalling those in the not far
distant French cathedral of St. Claude. Included
among the rest are David and the Sybil, who was
credited with prescience of the coming birth of
Christ:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Teste David cum Sybilla."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">In a chapel on the east of the south transept is
the tomb, with a modern statue, of Duke Henri
de Rohan, the Protestant leader, who was slain
at the battle of Rheinfelden in 1638. The
church has, of course, been stripped of its ancient
coloured glass, for we can hardly suppose that
Calvinistic Geneva of the sixteenth century lacked
its local "Blue Dick" or its incorrigible William
Dowsing; but luckily two splendid windows have
somehow escaped, and are now in safe possession
in the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire. One is a large
figure of St. John the Evangelist, and another of
St. Julian or St. James-the-Less. Preserved in
the same collection are two fifteenth-century
bench-ends, and a fragment of broken stall
canopy, that come also from the Cathedral.</p>

<p>Everyone should climb to the top gallery of
the great south tower, for there, on a fine day,
we are best in a position&mdash;it is the highest spot
in the whole city save the adjoining leaden flèche&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
study the topography of Geneva and the
surrounding country. Geneva, we then see,
though different from towns, such as Luxembourg,
Richmond, or Le Puy, whose actual site
and immediate environs in themselves are striking
and beautiful, is none the less set in the heart of
a general landscape which for varied splendour
and loveliness is hardly to be rivalled by any
other great city&mdash;and not at all in my experience&mdash;in
the western half of Europe. Immediately
to the east spread the waters of the lake,
intensely and uniquely blue, and dotted perhaps
with the graceful lateen sails that are only
found here, on Lac Leman, and again on the
Mediterranean. Owing to the direction at this
point of the axis of the lake (more or less
to the north-east), which points directly at the
heart of the great central plain of Switzerland,
between the Jura and the Alps, the distance is
closed along the water by no lofty chain of hills,
but merely dies away into flat and fruitful vale.
To the left of the lake, however, appears the
noble limestone escarpment that constitutes the
eastern boundary of the Jura, stretching for
nearly half-a-hundred miles, like a vast blue wall,
from its commencement on the Rhone, below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
city, in the neighbourhood of Bellegarde, far away
to the north-east, in the direction of Neuchâtel.
The position of Bellegarde itself is roughly fixed
by the great fort at Ecluse, seen clearly on its hill
above the narrow glen of the Rhone; for at Ecluse
(well named, like Cluses, on the Avre, for the
word means strait, or narrows) Jura and Alp
come close together, and confront one another
menacingly across the contracted gorge of the
Rhone. The spot is almost exactly paralleled
in England by the deep valley between Tebay
and Lowgill, which is also threaded by a great
trunk railway, though it happily needs no fort;
and where the Lake mountains and Howgill Fells,
which are out-liers of the so-called Pennine chain,
similarly confront one another across the shallow
stream of the Lune. Commencing then at Ecluse,
where Jura challenges Alp, the line of the lower
Alps may itself be slowly traced, as we slowly
turn our faces, past the Grand and Petit Salève,
which tower so immediately above Geneva itself,
and so grandly, with their long, parallel belts of
gleaming white limestone precipice, as we approach
it from the lake; past the broad, rich
valley of the lower Avre, which at this point
opens deeply into the mountain bosom of Savoy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
to the spot where the richly wooded Voirons sinks
gently to the azure waters of the Lake. This, if
the day be dull, or the distance indistinct, is
roughly the view that the eye commands from
the Cathedral tower across the old brown roofs,
immediately below us, of the upper city of
Geneva, and across the battalion of bright, white
villas that gleam from suburban woods. Contrariwise,
if the day be clear&mdash;and the number of such
days in this sunny climate is astonishingly great&mdash;the
whole landscape, at any time so beautiful,
is embellished and transfigured by the presence of
one grand object, that hangs so high in heaven,
though forty miles distant in a bee-line, and that
gleams so white and ætherial, that one almost
hesitates for a moment whether to address it as
cloud or mountain. For there, almost due south-east
from Calvin's city, though one doubts
whether Calvin's inward-brooding eye ever
brightened at its prospect, or ever heeded it more
than carelessly; there, in distant magnificence
more supreme, and in majesty of height more
completely realized than is experienced to my
knowledge in the case of any other great hill in
Europe (save only by Monte Rosa possibly, as
seen between Milan and Pavia); there, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
glorious central dome enshrouded in deep masses
of overwhelming snow, and even from this
distance those snows are palpably deep and overwhelming,
and not to be confounded for a moment
with mere thin and transient sprinkling; there,
towering above its immediate satellites with a
complete and unquestioned supremacy that is
never felt when we see it fore-shortened, as most
people come to see it, in the naked valley of
Chamonix; there, giving unity and perspective
to the whole vast and varied panorama, is the
dominating presence of Mont Blanc himself, even
at this great distance still patently a king. There
is a passage in <i>Præterita</i>, recalling one in Wordsworth,
in which Ruskin describes his pure delight
as a boy in the presence of the hills, without
seeking further to read their lesson, as Wordsworth
learnt to read it, and afterwards Ruskin
himself, in the light of "the still sad music of
humanity." "St. Bernard of La Fontaine," he
tells us in the chapter headed "Schaffhausen and
Milan," "looking out to Mont Blanc with his
child's eyes, sees above Mont Blanc the Madonna;
St. Bernard of Talloires, not the Lake of Annecy,
but the dead between Martigny and Aosta. But
for me the Alps and their people were alike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
beautiful in their snow and their humanity; and
I wanted, neither for them nor myself, sight of
any thrones in heaven but the rocks, or of any
spirits in heaven but the clouds."</p>

<p>Immediately round the Cathedral, on the crest
of the old acropolis, clusters most of what is still
left in Geneva of the ancient city state. City
state, in truth, it was, rather than capital, like
Sion or Berne, of a canton: the territory, in
fact, of Geneva was always insignificant, and
merely a civic adjunct&mdash;a hundred odd square
miles, or so, of suburban orchard, or garden.
The Canton of Geneva, in short, was subordinate
to the city, and never the city to the canton.
"Quand je secoue ma perruque," said Voltaire,
"je poudre toute la République."</p>

<p>Of ancient municipal buildings, perhaps the
most interesting is the Hôtel-de-Ville, which
exhibits a picturesque Renaissance staircase or
inclined plane. Opposite is the old Arsenal,
with its outside paintings&mdash;a feature that is typically
Swiss. We have noticed already the sites
of the old houses that were associated respectively
with Rousseau and Calvin in the Grande Rue
and the former Rue des Chanoines. At the foot
of the latter thoroughfare, in the Rue de la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Pélisserie, and also marked by a tablet, is the
house in which George Eliot resided between
October, 1849, and March, 1850. From near
the apse of the Cathedral we may descend steeply
to the low town along the shore of the lake,
either directly, by the Rue de la Fontaine, or,
more indirectly, by a network of little streets
that cluster round the mediæval church of the
Madelaine. The Rue de la Fontaine in itself is
worth a visit, with its tall, old, shabby tenements,
like those in the old town at Edinburgh.
I forget from what fountain it gets its name;
but Geneva, like other towns in Switzerland&mdash;like
every village in fact&mdash;is full of them.
None, that I know, has the character, or quaintness,
of some of those at Berne; but the pretty
Swiss custom of decorating them in summer
with growing flowers may be noted here with
gratitude and pleasure.</p>

<p>The modern splendour of Geneva, to which
we descend almost reluctantly from the old, grey,
upper city on the heights, if certainly very
modern, is also certainly very splendid; and
leaves us with the impression that the front
towards the quays, with its gardens, and palatial
hotels, and gigantic cafés, is one of the brightest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and gayest, and most animated scenes anywhere
to be met with on the Continent. Moreover, it
offers at least one point, where the Rhone, like
an arrow from the string, suddenly discharges
itself from the blue placidity of the lake, and
storms in triumphant volume through the openings
of the bridges to swirl past the little tree-shaded
Ile-de-Rousseau and the other islands that
lie behind it, where even the quiet lover of
Nature, to whom gay throngs of all sorts are
abhorrent, may feed his soul as completely with
splendid, natural spectacle as anywhere among
the torrents and glaciers of the remotest and
most secluded valleys in which this magnificent
stream has origin, and from which it descends in
thunder, but never in purity like this, to traverse
the whole Canton of the Valais from end to end,
and to repose at length in quiet in the lake.
To lean across the west parapet of the Pont-du-Mont
Blanc at Geneva, and to gaze down into
this deep volume of absolutely transparent and
deep ultramarine water that shoots forward with
Alpine strength and lightning-like rapidity, and
is only broken into sheets of seething, delicately
sky-blue foam at the point where its majestic
impetuosity is arrested by the dams of the electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
works, is to come face to face with just such a
combination of natural force and loveliness as is
nowhere, I think, to be found in Britain, and
perhaps at few spots in the Alps. The extraordinarily
deep-blue colour of the Lake of
Geneva, and of the Rhone where it first emerges,
and before it is polluted (alas! in half-a-mile or
so) by the influx of the grey and glacier-stained
Avre&mdash;till the last state of the Rhone, below
Geneva, is no better than its first, above Villeneuve&mdash;has
been the subject of comment and
learned inquiry, but has never, unless I mistake,
been satisfactorily explained. Most other Alpine
lakes, whether in Switzerland or Italy, are deep,
or emerald, green: and emerald, or deep green,
are the strong rivers that discharge from them&mdash;the
Linth from Zurich, or the Reuss at Lucerne,
or the noble Aar that lends grace to Thun.

<p>This exquisite phenomenon then, which has
been compared with the tender, suffused blue
that is seen when looking down into the depths
of a crevasse, has never been accounted for,
though theories are not lacking in profusion.
And not only is this nascent river the most
beautifully coloured and transparent thing on
earth&mdash;every pebble at the bottom is visible
through I dare not guess how many feet of
depth&mdash;but its surface is also the most lustrous
in the world. Even at night, when the moonlight
glances on its water, or at least the electric
lights on the promenade and bridges, this quality
of lustre, and to some extent of colour, still
remains proudly visible, when other rivers, if
still lustrous, would be black. In daylight, too,
this bridge is a pleasant spot to linger on, not
merely for joy of the crystal depths below, but
for joy of the scene above. Nowhere, I think,
is Geneva seen to better purpose than hence: to
the left the towers of its ancient Cathedral, high
on their crowded hill above the stream; in the
centre, the Ile-de-Rousseau, with its picturesque
clump of trees; and to the right, above more
old houses, the long blue wall of Jura, lofty
enough and abrupt enough wholly to hold the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
eye, till, turning with an effort, we cease to
sigh for Jura, because there, though at greater
distance, are the altogether more dazzling splendours
of the Alps.</p>

<p>Next to the ex-Cathedral the best object of
artificial attraction in Geneva is undoubtedly the
new Museum of Art and History. Few provincial
collections exceed, or even rival, it in the
interest of their specimens or their excellence of
arrangement. Here, in addition to the remains
of glass and wood-work, already mentioned, from
St. Pierre, are several relics&mdash;ladders, helmets, a
banner, etc.&mdash;of that famous Escalade by which
the Duke of Savoy&mdash;always an uneasy neighbour
to Geneva&mdash;attempted to take the city by stealth,
and did in fact nearly succeed in taking it, during
the night of December 11-12, 1602. Calvin had
been already nearly forty years dead (in 1564),
but his old friend and disciple, Theodore Beza,
in whose arms he had expired, and who, like
Calvin himself, was by birth a Frenchman, was
still living in Geneva, though then eighty-three
years old; and it was Beza who gave out the
next day, in public thanksgiving in church, the
one-hundred-and-twenty-fourth Psalm ("If the
Lord Himself had not been on our side") that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
said ever afterwards to have been sung on the
anniversary of the Escalade. Stored with these
relics in the basement are some important specimens
of thirteenth-century glass, or even earlier.
But perhaps the chief value of the museum is to
be found in the cases upstairs, with examples,
bronze and iron, of the pre-historic ages. Here,
in addition to the usual celts, daggers, spear-heads,
etc., that one finds in all collections of the sort, is
a really wonderful assemblage of bronze bracelets,
pins, knives, and razors from lake villages; whilst
the Iron Age is represented by tridents, shears,
safety-pins with spiral springs, choppers with
hooked points, and reaping-hooks, many of
which exactly resemble those still in use at the
present day: the persistence of shape is really
marvellous. Here too are long, deadly pins,
with big bead heads, precisely like those that
women still stick through their hats to-day,
though the world is more than two thousand
years older. Here too are human tibia bones,
each with its four bronze anklets still <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in situ</i>, and
here is one end of a "dug-out" canoe that was
found in the lake, at Morges, in 1878. Some
museums of this sort are distinctly dismal; but
this at Geneva is so rich in this particular direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
and so admirably marshalled, that even those
who are little interested in origins will not regret
an hour's loss of sunshine on lake and hill.</p>

<h3 id="Sec_II">II.</h3>

<p>I suppose one is justified, or even compelled, in
writing even a short sketch, such as this, of
Geneva and its lake, to say something of the
valleys that penetrate southward from its basin
into the mountain highlands of Savoy. The man
is to be pitied who can gaze at the distant snows
of Mont Blanc, or the Aiguille-du-Midi, from
the quays at Geneva, yet is stirred by no violent
passion to view them at closer quarters: who can
linger by the junction of blue Rhone and turbid
Avre, where the streams for a space flow parallel,
but do not consent to mix, yet experiences no impulse
to track up the Avre itself to its majestic
source, where it issues in volume and thunder
("magno cum murmure montis") from the foot
of the Mer-de-Glace. Few writers, in short, on
Geneva fail to conduct their readers to the bleak
upland vale of Chamonix; where they may
worship "at the temple's inner shrine" what
they have worshipped so long at a distance, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the Galilee, or vestibule. I do not, however,
propose to expend a deal of space in dealing with
the usual line of approach to Chamonix by way
of Bonneville and the Baths of St. Gervais, or
even on Chamonix itself. Nearly thirty years
ago, when I first travelled between the two
towns, but in the reverse direction, it was necessary
to drive by diligence the whole distance between
Geneva and Chamonix: now the journey
that took formerly a whole long summer day is
easily effected in a few short hours, and the old,
leisurely, unrestricted view from the coupé of
the diligence is bartered away for a series of flying
glimpses&mdash;and hardly that, if the compartment
is full&mdash;framed for half a minute, and lost
before fairly realized; seen, like the film of a
cinematograph, amid surroundings equally stifling
and dull. From St. Gervais, it is true, where the
ordinary railway terminates and the electric line
begins, you may stand, if you like, on the open
platform at the end of the little carriage, and
marvel thence, as you mount steeply, at the
depth of the wooded gorge below you, and at
the fierce waters of the Avre, and look back at
the bare, brown, limestone precipices of the
colossal Tête-à-l'Ane, or forward to the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
colossal snow-peaks that tower and still tower
above you in ever-increasing splendour, till you
climb at last to the bare strath of the cold, upland
valley that was once the monastic <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Campus
Munitus</i>, and are shocked perhaps by the vulgarity
and hopeless anti-climax of modern Chamonix itself.
Chamonix, indeed, though emphatically no
longer a mountain village, is picturesque enough
inside in the picturesque French fashion, regarded,
as it ought to be, as a mountain "ville-de-plaisir"&mdash;as
Luchon, for instance, is picturesque in the
Pyrenees, or as Mont Dore, among the highlands
of Auvergne. Visit the place in spring, when
winter-sports are over, and the tide of summer
tourists has not yet commenced to flow, or visit
it in autumn, when the tide has fairly ebbed, and
you may still catch something of the solemn inspiration
that filled the soul of Coleridge when
he wrote his great "Hymn to Mont Blanc." At
other times, I confess, the swarms of well-dressed
idlers&mdash;they infest the paths to the Flegère, or
Montanvert, like droves of human ants, and overflow
in aimless wandering the unfenced, communal
fields&mdash;are hardly less an annoyance than
Wordsworth found the ragged children who tried
to sell him pebbles when he landed on Iona. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Baths of St. Gervais, moreover, at the bottom of
the hill&mdash;not the picturesque old village on the
slopes above the Bon Nant&mdash;have been spoilt of
recent years by one of those vast electric "usines"
that form so vile a menace to the beauty of the
Alps. The strath of this lower valley, from the
gorge of Cluses, past Sallanches, to Chedde, can
never have been distinguished for its charm. It
is one of those lower Alpine valleys that are
absolutely flat-bottomed&mdash;they look like dried-up
marsh&mdash;and that are dusty and coarse in all their
features, whether natural or due to man: dusty
and coarse in their long, straight, unfenced roads;
dusty and coarse in their wastes of tumbled
boulders; dusty and coarse in their jungle of
stunted scrub; in their straggling cottages, and
untidy saw-mills; in the very flowers, parched
and sun-dried, that survive by the side of their
dull, dry roads. They are bordered, of course,
by noble hills; but even these look monotonous
and garish when seen across a foreground so
ragged and entirely flat. Compared with the
green valleys of the higher Alps, where the
emerald pastures fall in soft curves to the exact
level of the stream, and where every scrap of
detail is fresh with moss or flower, these hot and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
arid vales are like the blazing hours of noon, with
its pitiless lack of shade, in contrast with the long
soft shadows of evening, or the dewy freshness of
early morn.</p>

<p>Now for all these reasons&mdash;the presence of the
railway, the electric works at Chedde and St.
Gervais, and the dullness of the actual bottom of
the valley between St. Gervais and the "gate of
the hills" at Cluses&mdash;one would scarcely choose
to travel by this orthodox route from Geneva up
to Chamonix&mdash;though fine enough in places, and
almost everywhere full of interest&mdash;provided one
were offered a prettier alternative, and one not
otherwise too heavily handicapped in point of
greater distance or fatigue. Such a route, in
fact, there is, though for pedestrian, or horseman,
only, which, beautiful throughout, attains supreme
and final excellence in the section that lies beyond
Sixt. Probably very few tourists of the annual
thousands who visit Chamonix are ever sufficiently
adventurous to shoulder pack, or <i>rucksack</i>, and
thus desert the broad valley of the Avre, with its
rather obvious graces, for the shy and retiring
loveliness of the valley of the Giffre. The steam-tramway
along the road may, I think, legitimately
be taken as far as Samoëns, where it ends; for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
is at Samoëns that the interest of the walk begins.
Sixt, beyond Samoëns, is a charming old village,
at the junction of two wild Alpine streams that
descend respectively from the Buet (10,201 feet)
and the Pointe de Tanneverge (9,784 feet). Here
in the Middle Ages was a small Augustinian
abbey, the domestic buildings of which are now
utilized for a simple, but clean, hotel, and the
chapel of which is now the parish church. The
dining-room is the old refectory; and painted
round the wall-plate of its wooden ceiling may
still be read its history: "... hoc opus fecit
fieri Hubit' de Mon XI Abbas de Six Ano.
Dni. MDCXXII. Deus converset. I.H.S.
Maria."</p>

<p>From Sixt we ascend through forest by the
side of the rushing stream, through a landscape
that is enlivened with as many splashing waterfalls
as greeted Ulysses and his companions with
their music when they came to the afternoon
land of the Lotos Eaters. A little below the
Eagle's Nest, the pleasant summer home of the
late Mr. Justice Wills, the forest virtually ceases,
and the road ends altogether; and thenceforward
on to Chamonix we have only a mountain track,
or mule-path, which mounts at first abruptly by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
a series of sudden zig-zags, but afterwards for an
interval keeps a leveller upland route across wild
and desolate pastures that lie round the big
mountain tarn known as the Lac d'Anterne,
beyond which rise in superlative grandeur, for
more than two thousand feet, the giddy, sheer
rock precipices of the strangely named Tête-à-l'Ane.
All this is very splendid, and every inch
of going pleasant; but I have brought you all
this distance for a single point of view that bursts
suddenly into vision, without warning or preparation.
Suddenly, as perhaps you are getting a little
tired, or finding the landscape a trifle monotonous,
literally almost a single step brings you to a little
break in the ridge of the opposite hill, whence
the whole majestic chain of Mont Blanc&mdash;not
only the monarch himself, but his whole range of
attendant satellites and regally shattered aiguilles,
from the Aiguille du Tour, on the left, to the
Aiguille du Gouter, on the right&mdash;leaps splendidly
into view&mdash;such a vision of splintered crags, and
snows of dazzling, unsullied purity, and dark
hollows of sullen glacier, and plinth of green
pasture and forest, as certainly you will not find
anywhere else in the Alps, nor, for ought I know,
though the scale may be bigger, among Andes or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Himalayas. Nor does all this magnificence here
rise, as it rises when seen from closer and more
familiar quarters, from the Flegère or the Brévent,
directly from the foreground of the rather shabby
Vale of Chamonix, with its electric railways to
Argentière and the Montanvert, and with its unspeakable
vulgarity of an aerial flight, or whatever
they call their piece of villainy, up the pinnacles
of the Aiguille du Midi, and with Chamonix itself
in the centre, a mass of obtrusive roofs; but
here it springs heavenward from above, and beyond,
the long, dark ridge of the sombre Brévent
itself, which serves in its comparative humility at
once for measure and foil; whilst immediately
below us are the dark, unpeopled depths (save for
a small, solitary inn) of the upland valleys of the
Diosaz and its tributary streams. Around is utter
solitude, and wherever the eye can penetrate; and
in front this unspeakably splendid chain, revealed
in a single second, and viewed in its total length.
A man would perhaps do well, who wishes to
appreciate to perfection this sovereign of Alpine
hills, never to approach it more closely than this
crest of the Col d'Anterne.</p>

<h3 id="Sec_III">III.</h3>

<p>In America, I suppose, if you stand in the centre
of the Michigan shore of Lake Superior, you
can no more make out Canada across the water
than a man can make out Normandy though he
strain his eyes for ever from Selsey or Beachy
Head. A lake, in fact, may be so big that it
ceases, for all landscape effect, to be a lake at all,
and becomes merely an inland sea. Perhaps the
most beautiful lakes of all are those of such
modest dimension&mdash;yet more than mere ponds
or tarns&mdash;that you can comprehend their total
shore-line from some eminence on their bank, as
Buttermere, for example, is comprehended from
the slopes of Red Pike, or Loch Lomond, very
nearly, from the summit of Ben Voirlich. The
Lake of Geneva, from this point of view, is
much nearer Buttermere than Lake Superior;
but still, in a sense, not whimsical, but real,
must be reckoned as much too big. And not
only this, but its basin also is a hotch-pot of
different kinds of scenery, and of different ranges
of hills. It is encradled, as a whole, neither in
Alp nor Jura, but lies rather in a plain between
the two. It's head, indeed, penetrates superficially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
into the lower Alps of Vaud; whilst the
greater Alps of the Valais, and in particular
the noble Dent-de-Morcles, and the yet nobler
Dent-du-Midi, guard its upper waters at such a
distance that, though really far removed, they
appear as we approach to rise almost from its
margin, and form an immediate and splendid
setting for its reaches above Evian and Vevey.
Its southern shore, again, is bordered fairly
closely, for almost its whole length, by rugged
Alps of Savoy that open behind Thonon to
admit glimpses even of the far-away snows of
Mont Blanc himself, revealed in crowning
majesty beyond the valley of the Dranse. So
far, indeed, Lac Leman may be fairly claimed
for Alpine; but turn to the opposite shore, and
we must tell another tale. From Geneva towards
Lausanne the background is formed, though at
considerable distance, by the south-east escarpment
of the Jura, whose long, level-crested wall
of limestone rock&mdash;exactly like the long limestone
wall of the Pennine hills above the Vale
of Eden, or of Mendip above the marshes of
mid-Somerset&mdash;affords the strongest contrast in
the world to the abruptly pointed, opposite,
Savoyard summits of the Dent d'Oche or Pointe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
de Grange, though not without analogy, near
the city of Geneva, in the hog-backed ridge of
the Grand Salève, which might almost belong to
Jura itself. Moreover, this ridge of Jura, which
at Geneva itself is not more than some ten miles
or so away from the lake, gradually, after Rolle,
or Aubonne, in its straight course towards the
north-east, trends farther and farther from the
lake, which here begins to curve towards
the south, so that part of the north shore of
the lake, between Rolle and Lausanne, actually
abuts on neither Alp nor Jura, but terminates,
rather tamely, on the great central plain of
Switzerland. Geneva, however, though thus
diverse in setting and scenery&mdash;for the hill forms
of the Alps, to go back again for a moment to
our familiar home comparison, are as widely
different from the hill forms of the Jura as are
those of English Lakeland from those of the
opposite Pennine chain&mdash;is superbly simple in
shape. It is, in fact, an almost perfect crescent,
or half moon (save that the south-east horn at
Chillon is unduly blunted and truncated), the
convexity of which is turned towards the north,
whilst its concave face embraces the hills of
Chablais, or Savoy. It follows that, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
appreciate Geneva as a whole, so far as this can
ever be achieved in the case of so big a sheet of
water, it is necessary to view it from the high
ground, and from the vineyards, above Aubonne
or Lausanne, which command, more or less imperfectly,
both curves of the bending lake. It
follows again that Geneva, with this form of
extreme simplicity, exhibits none of the mystery
and surprises of such highly complex lakes as
Lugano or Lucerne: everything here is exceedingly
straightforward, and depends for its effect,
not on continually new grouping of interlocking
ranges of hill, but on the gradual majestic unfolding
of a short series of dignified scenes.</p>

<p>It will be gathered from what has already
been said that, for the greater part of its length,
the finest shore views of Geneva are commanded
from its north, or convex, margin, looking south
across splendidly broad stretches of water&mdash;opposite
Thonon, where it is nearly at its
broadest, almost exactly eight miles&mdash;to the
grandly marshalled Alps of Chablais that tower
above the opposite shore. To look northward
from this opposite shore, across the water to the
Jura and Central Plain, is to contemplate quite a
different lake, and one of less superlative degree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
It so happens, again, that the north shore is the
more interesting of the two, by reason of the
succession of ancient and picturesque towns, such
as Nyon, Rolle, Morges, and Aubonne&mdash;to say
nothing of partially modernized Vevey, and of
almost wholly modernized Lausanne (which has
yet in its Cathedral a jewel of priceless worth),
or of castles like Vufflens and Chillon&mdash;that
stud its immediate shore, or lie barely a trifle
inland. The best way, no doubt, to appreciate
Geneva is to sail again and again up its gracious
sheet of blue; yet no one who has leisure will
repent a quiet pilgrimage, best made I think on
bicycle, to the villages and towns along its north
bank.</p>

<p>This pilgrimage we hope to make presently;
but for the moment it will be as well to turn our
attention to the two gay watering-places of Evian
and Thonon (promoted of recent years to be
Evian- and Thonon-les-Bains, though an old
Murray in my possession, published in 1872,
knows them as Evian and Thonon only), and to
penetrate a little deeper up the valley of the
Dranse to the roots of the rocky mountains that
form so grand a background to the lake as viewed
from the castle terrace at Nyon, or from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
cathedral porch at Lausanne. Neither Thonon
nor Evian need detain us long; for, though each
has a nucleus of ancient town, each is now rather
overwhelmed by its vast and fashionable modern
hotels. Respectively they lie to the west and
east of the Dranse, which, descending in three
separate streams from the highlands of Savoy&mdash;the
Dranse proper, the Dranse d'Abondance, and
the Dranse de Morzine&mdash;here pushes out in united
delta into the lake. Thonon is the capital of the
old Savoyard province of Chablais, and has actually,
in excuse of its modern pretensions, a set of
chalybeate springs. Evian, however, with water
containing bicarbonate of soda, is much the
quainter and pleasanter, in its ancient parts, of
the two; has also the great advantage, in comparison
with Thonon, of being situated farther
to the east, and thus commanding nobler views
of the mountains above Vevey, and towards the
head of the lake; and lastly is distinguished for
its pleasant, tree-shadowed promenades by the
actual water-side (whereas Thonon is on the cliff
above the lake), whence you see across the blue
expanse the white houses of Lausanne, clustered
in profusion on the sunny slopes of the opposite
shore, or twinkling in the twilight with a million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
electric lamps. No one should quit either Evian
or Thonon without making first an "inland
voyage" up the valley of the Dranse to visit the
quaint little mountain villages of Abondance and
St. Jean d'Aulph (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de Alpibus</i>). At Abondance is a
small monastic church, with a picturesque cloister,
that dates in its inception from as early as the
sixth century; whilst at St. Jean (on the whole
less charming) are the very pretty ruins of a little
Cistercian abbey that is remarkable in more than
one direction&mdash;its possession of a triforium and
some foliated capitals&mdash;for its unusually early
departure from the usual architectural severity of
the early Cistercian rule. The valley of the
Dranse d'Abondance is refreshingly green and
pastoral, and is bounded in places by magnificently
rocky hills; but it is only towards its
head, beyond the Chapel of Abondance, and before
reaching the low pass that leads to Morgins
in Switzerland, that the sudden apparition of the
splendid Dent-du-Midi&mdash;pre-eminently entitled,
notwithstanding its comparatively low height
(only 10,695 feet), to rank in point of form and
truly Alpine aspect amidst the giants of the Alps&mdash;lifts
the whole landscape in a moment to the
level of Alpine sublimity. Abondance, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
much frequented by French families in summer,
has absolutely nothing of the modern fashionable
spirit that is rather too apparent at Thonon or
Evian-les-Bains. Its inns, though comfortable
enough for those who are not unduly fastidious,
are still genuine mountain hostelries; and the
type of French family life, though possibly
wholly bourgeois, that may be studied here in
August is amusing and piquant indeed, in contrast
with the rather dull banalities of much more
fashionable watering-places, such as Vichy or
Aix-les-Bains.</p>

<p>We come at length to that north shore of the
lake which already we have noted with critical
preference. We shall penetrate no longer amidst
royally wooded hills, nor linger on mossy banks
by the side of impetuous mountain streams. Our
immediate natural environment, on the contrary,
will now be comparatively dull; but by way of
compensation we shall have always across the
water, provided the day be clear, the massed and
tumultuous grouping of those stern and shapely
mountains of Savoy, which hitherto we have inspected,
in the three secluded valleys of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Dranse, by sample and parcel only (as one cannot
see the wood for the number of the trees). Moreover,
instead of fashionable Thonon, and perhaps
still more fashionable Evian, we have now in
rapid succession a series of villages and small
towns, along the actual margin of the lake, that
are mostly of very old-world aspect, and often of
some historical regard. We shall begin, however,
by deserting the actual littoral for a short digression
inland over the frontier into France, to visit one
of those two or three great literary shrines that
are connected with Lac Leman, and are not without
interest to the student of the French Revolution
and of modern thought.</p>

<p>From Geneva to Ferney Voltaire is a pleasant
jaunt of about five miles. There is a steam-tramway
along the road, but this hardly detracts from
its agreeable rurality, which is remarkable, as we
first quit Geneva, for its number of good and old-fashioned
residences, and especially for the abundance
and luxuriant growth of the timber along
its borders, which is more English-like in character
than one usually finds in France. Ferney
consists of a single long street of white houses,
backed, as we approach it, by the long blue wall
of the Jura, towards whose foot we have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
steadily advancing ever since Calvin's Geneva was
left behind. From Calvin's Geneva to Voltaire's
Ferney is a journey, long indeed in the history of
human thought, but quickly enough effected on
bicycle or foot. The château where Voltaire
lived from 1759 to 1777 lies towards the head
of the village, and was built, like most of the
village, by the philosopher himself. Unhappily,
it is shown only in summer, and then only on a
single afternoon in the week; but as it is said to
have been greatly altered since Voltaire's residence&mdash;though
his bedroom still remains&mdash;little, perhaps,
is missed, especially as the front of the house is
well seen through the iron gates at the end of the
public drive, as well as the little chapel to the
left that he raised to the honour of God: "Deo
Erexit Voltaire." Whatever view may be formed
of Voltaire's religious and ethical opinions, undoubtedly
there are aspects of his life to be
praised. It was at Ferney that he caused to be
educated, under his superintendence, the grandniece
of the dramatist Corneille, whom he had
"rescued from extreme want," and whom he
endowed with the proceeds of an edition of her
ancestor's works that he himself was at pains to
edit. It was at Ferney, again, that he interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
himself so passionately in denouncing the breaking
on the wheel of poor Jean Calas by the Parliament
and priests of Toulouse. English poets, no doubt,
have conspired to present his character in a very
unfavourable light. His contemporary, Cowper,
writes of him:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The Scripture was his jest book, whence he drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bon-mots</i> to gall the Christian and the Jew;"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">whilst Wordsworth styles his "Optimist," or
makes his "Wanderer" style it:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"this dull product of a scoffer's pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impure conceits discharging from a heart<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">It is fair after this to recall what is said by Mr.
Lecky: "The spirit of intolerance sank blasted
beneath his genius. Wherever his influence
passed, the arm of the Inquisitor was palsied, the
chain of the captive riven, the prison door flung
open. Beneath his withering irony persecution
appeared not only criminal but loathsome, and
since his time it has ever shrunk from observation,
and masked its features under other names.
He died leaving a reputation that is indeed far
from spotless, but having done more to destroy
the greatest of human curses than any other of
the sons of men."</p>

<p>From Ferney we return to Switzerland, and
the shores of the lake, at Versoix, which impresses
one disagreeably as dusty and untidy,
though the Duc de Choiseul in the eighteenth
century destined it as a rival to Geneva. "A
pier was built," says Murray, "a Grand' Place
laid down, streets running at right angles were
marked out; but beyond this the plan was
never carried into execution. Hence the verses
of Voltaire:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"'A Versoix nous avons des rues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et nous n'avons point de maisons.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Probably the streets have been long since grassed
up; certainly one does not note them in merely
passing through as one notes the streets of
Winchelsea (where the town, however, was
built, though it since has largely perished). At
Coppet, which comes next in succession, but
before reaching which the Canton of Geneva
is exchanged for Canton Vaud, the village, in
pleasant contrast, is entirely delightful, with a
little church that faces directly on the street, and
that has a picturesque flamboyant west front and
a delightful little bell-turret. This sleepy little
village is the second literary shrine that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
encounter on our pilgrimage along the northern
shore of Lac Leman; for here, in the ancient
château on the slope above the lake, was the
home for many years (between 1790 and 1804)
of the famous Monsieur Necker, Minister of
Finance to Louis XVI., and the occasional home,
both then and later, of his still more famous
daughter, the Baroness de Staël. Necker, of
course, was Genevois by birth, though German
by descent, and even Anglo-Irish. According
to Carlyle, he was a man of boundless vanity:
"Her father is Minister, and one of the gala
personages; to his own eyes the chief one ...
'as Malebranche saw all things in God, so
M. Necker sees all things in Necker'&mdash;a
theorem that will not hold." Madame de Staël
is perhaps now best remembered for her letters;
but it is worth recalling at this moment, when
the German genius has again been weighed in
the balance and found wanting, that it was her
book of German eulogy ("De l'Allemagne,"
published in London in 1813) that did for the
German genius in France something of the same
sort of friendly office that Carlyle himself performed
for it in England. She is remarkable, too,
indirectly, as the subject of an epigram, as neat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
in its way, and as cutting, as that which we have
cited of her father. Napoleon, when he banished
her, summed up her talents in a line (it may
well have been unjust): "la manie qu'elle a
d'écrire sur tout et à propos de rien." She died
at Paris in 1817, and is buried here at Coppet;
but I have not sought her grave. The château,
at any rate, may be easily found, for it stands
high above the town, a picturesque old pile,
with the delightful mellow colouring&mdash;white
walls, with gay green blinds, and vast slopes of
soft brown roof&mdash;that for some odd reason unexplored
is never found in England, but obtrudes
itself at every turn in Switzerland, or Italy, or
France. It is built round a courtyard, the
entrance to which is framed outside with masses
of wistaria.</p>

<p>From Coppet on to Nyon the way is well
enough, with the azure levels of the lake for
companion on the right, and with Jura, of a
darker blue, like a rampart on the left. Nyon,
placed pleasantly just short of the point where
the lake broadens suddenly from about three to
about seven miles by a huge expansion to the
south, and thus at the termination of the so-called
Petit Lac, whose littoral we have hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
followed from Versoix, and less closely from
Geneva, is one of those delightful old towns&mdash;Rolle
and Morges belong to the same category&mdash;that
lend such grace and character to the Swiss
shore of the lake, and have such delightful
inland parallels at Aubonne, Morat, and Moudon.
Morat, I suppose, though it lacks the glorious
lake, and the majestic distant snows, here still
visible, of Mont Blanc, must carry away the
palm as a triumph of pure mediævalism; but,
Morat put aside, there is hardly another small
town in Switzerland so wholly delightful as this
(the Roman <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Noviodunum</i>) in its charm of situation,
or so rich in varied combination of artificial
and natural grace. High above the quays rises
the old sixteenth-century castle, the residence of
the Bernese bailiffs at a time when Canton Vaud
was a mere appanage of Berne, though Geneva
still succeeded in maintaining her independence.
You may reach it from the shore by a multiplicity
of ways&mdash;directly, by one of the narrow
lanes that climb steeply from the lake; or, less
painfully, by the broad terrace walk that rises
gradually westward below the old town wall,
through avenues of tortured plane-trees of the
familiar foreign type, to the pleasant Promenade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
des Maronniers, with its growth of vigorous
chestnuts, and its splendid prospect of lake and
mountain. From here, or from the sister terrace
that lies to the south of the château, the opposite
hills of Chablais are now become noble objects:
not merely Mont Blanc himself, always and insistently
a king, but lesser rocky heights that
lack only summer snow&mdash;the Dent d'Oche
beyond Evian, the Pointe de Grange and the
Cornette de Bise (curiously enough, according
to some maps&mdash;and anyhow there is only a
difference of a mètre&mdash;both exactly of the same
height, and each of them, still more curiously,
just exactly 8,000 feet high) on either side
of Abondance, and the pinnacled Roc d'Enfer&mdash;to
justify as attendant squires to their great
and peerless king. On the way between the
two terraces is passed the parish church, in
part, I think, of the fifteenth century, but with
traces of Romanesque. The castle itself, on its
sovereign brow, is picturesque enough, with its
round towers at the corners (but one is octagonal),
and its extinguisher, or pepper-pot, turrets&mdash;which
are found again in Scotland, who borrowed
so industriously from France, but never, I think, in
England&mdash;and with its curious wooden galleries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
in an additional courtyard to the east. Inside
is the town museum, with some lake village
antiquities of the Bronze Age, in addition to the
usual banalities of stuffed animals and birds: it
is perhaps just worth visiting when the door is
open, but hardly when you have to get the key.</p>

<p>From Nyon on to Rolle we still keep closely
to the lake, though never on its margin, past unfenced
woods at intervals that invite us to step
aside to hunt for lily-of-the-valley and Solomon's
seal in their "green of the forests' night." Always
across the water are the solemn, splendid summits
of Savoy: always on our left the level line of
Jura, which after Rolle, however, retires from
the lake to give place to the central plain of
Switzerland, which here debouches on the waters
till we meet the Alps beyond Lausanne. Rolle
is another quaint old town, consisting chiefly of
one long, old-fashioned street, with another typical
castle placed at its farther end; but in this case
both town and castle are built wholly on the
level, on the margin of the lake. The Dent-du-Midi
is now visible to the right of the Pointe
de Grange, but has not yet assumed the isolated
supremacy that it wears presently in the landscape,
being partly merged for the moment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
the company of hills. A little beyond Rolle a
turning to the left mounts slowly up the hill past
a lonely little burial-ground, and through the
rich vineyards of La Côte, to the upland town
of Aubonne. I took this road myself on a mild
evening towards the close of April, chiefly because
I was drawn to Aubonne by what Byron wrote
of it in his Journal under date September 29,
1816. "In the evening reached Aubonne (the
entrance and bridge something like that of
Durham), which commands by far the finest
view of the Lake of Geneva; twilight; the moon
on the lake; a grove on the height, and of very
noble trees. Here Tavernier (the Eastern traveller)
bought (or built) the château, because the site resembled
and equalled that of <i>Erivan</i>, a frontier
city of Persia; here he finished his voyages, and
I this little excursion,&mdash;for I am within a few
hours of Diodati, and have little more to see, and
no more to say." I am not sorry that I took this
road, for, ever mounting higher, it commands
ever wider and wider views of the crescent lake,
whose centre we now approach, in both directions,
with the glorious Chablais mountains embraced
in its noble curve. Aubonne, however, is
no more like Durham&mdash;I speak, of course, of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
own impressions: Byron saw it with different
eyes&mdash;than any other old town that is perched
on the edge of a winding ravine, with a river
and bridge at the bottom. Certainly any resemblance
it has&mdash;I do not admit any&mdash;is due
to natural situation, and not at all to artificial
charm. The parish church, which contains, however,
the grave of the great Admiral Duquesne,
who is commemorated by a statue in the market
square of his native town of Dieppe, is apparently
of little architectural interest (I did not get inside),
and the castle is of no account at all.
Durham to my ignorance has only one real rival,
where the great red-brick cathedral and castle
of Albi are piled above the Tarn like Durham
above the Wear. It is worth your while, however,
to make this digression to Aubonne (quite
a pretty little town) for the sake of the long
ascent from Rolle, through miles of purple vineyard,
and for the sake of the journey back to
Morges, where we regain the margin of the lake
and the main highroad from Geneva to Lausanne.
The descent, by way of contrast, is through continuous
apple-orchard and meadow, the pink and
white blossom floating freely round your shoulders
as you pursue the unfenced road in middle spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<div id="ip_50" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i_067.jpg" width="600" height="419" alt="" /><div class="caption">LAUSANNE CATHEDRAL FROM MONTBENON.</div></div>

<p>Morges is another quaint old town, with yet
another quaint old castle, and with a glorious
view of Mont Blanc, seen in this case in long
perspective up the valley of the Dranse, which
opens deeply through the heart of the Savoyard
mountains on the opposite shore of the lake. It
is worth while landing here for a few hours, if
only to mount the slopes behind the town, deep
with wood and orchard, to the noble old castle
of Vufflens, which is perhaps the best of its class
in Switzerland. Seen from the surface of the
lake&mdash;and it is seen thence conspicuously&mdash;this
has a very modern look, and suggests that the
whole building has been grossly over-restored.
You never doubt, in fact, that the place is still
inhabited, and most likely furbished up to the
point of loss of interest. You approach with
heavy heart, but are pleasantly surprised to find
only part of the pile still occupied, apparently as
a farm, whilst the whole is quite unspoilt. The
plan is widely different from that of Nyon or
Chillon (themselves not really similar), and absolutely
unparalleled by anything in Britain.
Tower-houses were still built in England as late
as the fifteenth century&mdash;Tattershall in Lincolnshire
is a prominent example&mdash;but these were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
really keeps; and they were primarily meant, not
for places of refuge in the last resort, but principally
for residence and comfort. The great
fourteenth-century donjon at Vufflens, on the
contrary, is plainly intended for defence not less
than the Tower of London in the eleventh century,
or than Rochester keep in the twelfth. Moreover,
this enormous tower&mdash;it is one hundred
and sixty feet high, and thus again without
equal or rival in England, though formerly
surpassed by the great cylinder at Coucy-le-Château
in France, which was actually about
two hundred feet&mdash;is girt about its base with
four lower towers, or satellites, as though for
extra strength: the whole is very grim and
menacing. It is built of yellow brick, and
everywhere heavily machicolated. The vaulted
kitchen, towards the basement, has a very striking
fireplace, with a vine pattern running round in a
deeply hollowed moulding. A vice, or spiral
stair, ascends in the thickness of the south wall,
which is thickened out to hold it in the form of
a circular turret. Most of the roof is modern;
but the visitor should notice the heavy wooden
shutters that close the big, segmental-headed
openings for hurling stones or shooting arrows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
and that run on wheels in wooden troughs, so
that a man might discharge his missile and immediately
close the aperture ere the enemy could
reply. The view, of course, is magnificent, and
would alone repay the climb, unless the visitor
happens to be giddy-headed. To the south of
this great tower lies an open courtyard, and to
the south of this, again, is the dwelling-house, or
palace. This planning, in my experience, is
unique; but there seems to be something like
it (I speak only from distant view) at the great
country castle of the Bishops of Lausanne at
Lucens, which forms so conspicuous and delightful
a feature on the hill on the west side
of the valley of the Broye between Moudon and
Payerne, in that delightful central vale of Switzerland
that is perhaps so seldom visited, yet combines
such unexpected charm of pleasantly pastoral
landscape with such wealth of old-world interest
as we find at Avenches (the Roman <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aventicum</i>),
Morat, and Estavayer.</p>

<p>I mention these places with less reluctance,
though certainly not on the shores of Lac Leman,
because they may all be easily visited from
Lausanne, and to some degree may even be
thought connected with it&mdash;Lucens, because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Bishop-Princes of Lausanne (who, like the Bishop-Princes
of Coire, were also Electors of the Holy
Roman Empire) had here a noble hunting-seat;
Moudon, because its lovely thirteenth-century
church is supposed to exhibit close analogies to
Lausanne Cathedral; and Avenches, because this
was actually the seat of the Bishop's stool before
this was translated to Lausanne by Bishop Marius
in 590. Lausanne itself is now a city of very
modern aspect, stretching with its villas in the
usual straggling Helvetic fashion&mdash;in contrast
with the neat compactness of France: Neuchâtel
and Bienne are other bad examples&mdash;for a distance
of nearly eight miles along the gentle slopes
of Mont Jorat that impend above the lake, and
presenting, as seen from the water, a long line
of clustered white houses (not unpicturesque in
distant view), crowned by the lofty tower of its
beautiful cathedral of Notre Dame. This is a
purely residential city, and gives one the same
impression as Milan of superabundant prosperity
and wealth. These factors, indeed, have proved
its ruin&mdash;I mean, of course, æsthetically&mdash;for the
Swiss (they are great iconoclasts) have of recent
years remodelled it so drastically that soon, one
is afraid, there will be nothing ancient left save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
here and there a church, preserved like flies in
amber. In every direction are fine new streets,
with splendid new houses and blocks of tenements.
The result, no doubt, will be very
magnificent; but Morat is more to my taste, or
Payerne. Certain old quarters of Bâle have thus
recently been levelled, and Neuchâtel is now
almost wholly of modern aspect. A city, no
doubt, belongs primarily to the people who inhabit
it; they have to live their lives in it, and
consult their own convenience; but at least one
may be permitted to hope that this sort of civic
madness will not hastily lay criminal hands on
Geneva, or Berne, or Fribourg.</p>

<p>Lausanne itself is built at some little height
above the lake, and visitors land from the steamer
at Ouchy, which at once is port and suburb.
Here, "at a small inn" (then the Ancre, but
now the Hôtel d'Angleterre: everything at
Lausanne expands to over-maturity), Byron wrote
his "Prisoner of Chillon," perhaps the best of
his poems in irregular metre, in the short space of
two days, whilst detained "by stress of weather,"
"thereby adding one more deathless association
to the already immortalized localities of the
Lake." From Ouchy ascend at once by cable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
tramway, unless you have a particular fancy for
perambulating miles of new streets, to the old
"cité" on the height; and climb at once to the
Cathedral of Notre Dame. Here, standing at
the entrance to the great south porch, with its
noble Romanesque statuary, and with its glorious
views across the water to the splendidly rocky
summits of Savoy, you can easily forget the gay
swarms of pacing idlers, and even a great bun-shop
that for vastness and magnificence (and
Lausanne has less than fifty thousand souls!)
would strike you with astonishment in Piccadilly
or Regent Street. This Cathedral of Notre
Dame is of about the same length as Beverley
Minster, or King's College Chapel at Cambridge;
and is not only a splendid example of thirteenth-century
architecture (the classic moment of
Gothic), but far and away the finest monument
of ecclesiastical art in Switzerland. Protestant
since 1536, when its Bishop was deposed&mdash;he
has now his throne at Fribourg&mdash;the interior
suffers, of course, from the usual cold and bare
austerity that characterizes a Calvinistic place of
worship hardly less in Switzerland than Holland.
Of recent years, however, it has been lovingly
restored, and the lack of Catholic furniture and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
ritual&mdash;I write always from the æsthetic point
of view, and never from that of divinity&mdash;is
perhaps felt no worse at Lausanne, or, for the
matter of that, at Geneva, than it is felt in
Dunblane or Glasgow Cathedral. Remarkable
externally is the north-west tower, with its
curious open-work buttresses like those at Bamberg
and Laon: remarkable inside are the early
sixteenth-century stalls, now misplaced in the
south nave aisle; the extravagant complication
of the vaulting system in the nave (it is different
in almost every bay); the exquisite beauty of the
south end of the south transept; and the four
or five recumbent effigies, or monuments, of
mediæval Bishops that are still allowed on sufferance
in this abode of rigid presbyterianism. One of
these is said in Murray (but Baedeker ignores it)
to be that of Pope Felix V., previously Duke of
Savoy and Bishop of Geneva, who retired from
the Papal throne to end his days as a mere monk
at Ripaille, near Thonon, and died there in the
monastery in 1451.</p>

<div id="ip_56" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i_076.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" /><div class="caption">MONTREUX FROM THE LAKE&mdash;AUTUMN.</div></div>

<p>Eastward from Lausanne, the hills, now foot-stools
of the Alps, drop more immediately to the
actual margin of the lake than any yet encountered
from Geneva to Lausanne. From top to bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
they are richly dotted with vineyards, with hardly
a green field in between; and everywhere among
these vineyards, on the slope of the hillside, are
innumerable little white villages, with their
mellow red-brown roofs, clustered at frequent
intervals round a central parish church. Opposite,
as we advance, the prospect of distant Alps
grows more and more magnificent, as the view
opens deeper and deeper, beyond the head of the
lake, into the great valley of the Rhone. So we
come at last to Vevey, the second town of Vaud,
from whose pleasant quay, with its lines of young
chestnuts and planes, in the neighbourhood of the
Marché pier, is got what is perhaps the last good
littoral view, as we journey in this direction, of
the glorious head of the lake, without base
suburban admixture to disguise and disfigure the
foreground. The Marché itself is open to the
lake, but enclosed on its other three sides by
old-fashioned brown-roofed houses, among which
stand out prominent the picturesque open arcades
of the Market House, and above which, on the
hill, though backed itself by charmingly wooded
lines of higher hill, rises the tower of the old
town church. To the left, as we look eastward,
is the prettily timbered promontory of the Tour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
de Peilz (the tower itself is visible), which luckily
shuts out the long line of villas past Clarens and
Montreux; and beyond this, again, the gaping
valley of the Rhone opens in unrivalled magnificence
deep into the bosom of now considerable
Alps, guarded on the left by the sharp, horn-like
precipices of the noble Dent-de-Morcles
(9,775 feet), and on the right by the still nobler,
boldly cut, square summit of the Dent-du-Midi
(10,695 feet). The view is one of simple magnificence,
not of such involved and complicated
hill forms as we contemplate with a different
kind of pleasure from the quays at Lucerne, but
compounded only of a few grand elements. The
lights are always changing on this stupendous
mountain range; now the distant hills are intensely
blue, now purple, or red, in the sunset;
now their summits stand up sharply in an unbroken
summer sky, now their edges are blurred by
fleecy white clouds, or obscured by golden mists,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"curling with unconfirm'd intent,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">but never static for a moment, or less than unearthly
and beautiful.</p>

<p>I have spoken deliberately of this grand view
from the quays at Vevey as the last good littoral
view (and I put the stress on "littoral") that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
gets of the lake as one continues on one's journey
eastward from Lausanne, or Ouchy, to Chillon.
The littoral, in fact, from Vevey as far as Chillon
is now virtually a continuous line of huge, flaunting
hotels, restaurants, villas, and tea-rooms: not
even the French Riviera between Cannes and
Mentone, which I take to be the second vulgarest
spot in Europe, has forfeited so entirely its original
character, or, from the scenic point of view, been
so utterly ruined. The line of devastation, it is
true, is luckily very thin; and though the hills
above Montreux and Territet are themselves
loaded at frequent intervals with monster hotels,
and laced in every direction with a perplexing
network of lifts and mountain railways, it must
frankly be confessed that to look at this five-mile-long
string of pleasure towns from a distance&mdash;as,
for instance, from those windows of Chillon
Castle that project farthest into the lake&mdash;is a
much less trying test of temper than to contemplate
the glories of the head of the lake with
Territet or Montreux for foreground. The destruction
of these odd five miles of natural loveliness&mdash;and
such natural loveliness&mdash;forms part
of a fierce denunciation by the late Mr. Ruskin,
which those who hardly think at all will probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
think extravagant, but which seems to others
entirely just: "You have destroyed the Clarens
shore of the Lake of Geneva." Clarens, indeed,
was formerly a place of such exquisite loveliness
that Rousseau chose it as the ideal dwelling-place
for the heroine of his "Nouvelle Héloïse." "Allez
à Vevey," he says in the fourth book of his "Confessions,"
"visitez le pays, examinez les sites, promenez-vous
sur le lac, et dites si la Nature n'a pas
fait ce beau pays pour une Julie, pour une Claire,
et pour un St. Preux; mais ne les y cherchez pas."
Nor was Byron, coming here in 1816, any less
enthusiastic. "I have traversed," he writes in a
letter of June 27 of that year to Mr. Murray&mdash;"I
have traversed all Rousseau's ground with the
'Héloïse' before me, and am struck to a degree
that I cannot express with the force and accuracy
of his descriptions and the beauty of their reality.
Meillerie, Clarens, and Vevey, and the Château
de Chillon, are places of which I shall say little,
because all I could say must fall short of the impressions
they stamp." And Byron himself, with
the "Héloïse" in recollection, addresses Clarens
in the third canto of "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage,"
in the stanzas <span class="locked">beginning&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Clarens! sweet Clarens, birthplace of deep Love!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">which Sir Edward Bridges pronounces "exquisite."
Yet not the natural beauty of Clarens <span class="locked">itself&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">"'tis lone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wonderful, and deep, and hath a sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sense, and sight of sweetness; here the Rhone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath spread himself a couch, the Alps have reared a throne"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">&mdash;nor the associations with Rousseau and Byron,
could save this "little nook of mountain ground"
from being sacrificed to the dictates of a thoughtless
and idle fashion. "You have destroyed the
Clarens shore of the Lake of Geneva."</p>

<p>One is glad indeed that the famous Castle of
Chillon, with which we must now conclude our
perambulation of the north shore of the lake, and
the little walled town of Villeneuve, which now,
however, notwithstanding its name, seems ancient
and venerable indeed in comparison with this
gay modernity that pulsates at its doors, should
lie just beyond the limit of this land of ruined
Edens, and should thus restore us to the right
mood in which to take farewell of the Lake
of Geneva. Chillon is far from the finest
castle, considered merely as a building, in
Switzerland (an honour due to Vufflens), nor,
in fact, is it even the most beautifully situated
(an honour surely due to the crag-perched residence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
of the old Bishop-Princes of the Valais on
the towering rock of Sion). Its chief curiosity
of site is the immense depth of water that lies
immediately below its walls, which is sometimes
said (I cannot vouch for so astonishing a
statement) to have been "fathomed to the depth
of 800 feet, French <span class="locked">measure"&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Lake Leman lies by Chillon's walls:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand feet in depth below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its massy waters meet and flow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus much the fathom-line was sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Chillon's snow-white battlement;"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">but it is due neither to its value as a specimen
of military architecture, nor to its charm of
situation, nor to this marvel of subterraneous
precipice, that Chillon maintains the extended
reputation that renders it perhaps the most
visited and best known of all the many famous
castles of the world. Its cult is rather due to its
association with Byron's "Prisoner of Chillon,"
which was written, as we have seen, in the old
Ancre Inn at Ouchy in the short course of a
couple of days in 1816. Byron himself has
entitled this a "fable," and it has certainly little
or nothing to do with the historical Bonnivard,
who was certainly imprisoned here for six years,
between 1530 and 1536, but was released in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
latter year, and subsequently became a Protestant,
and married four wives in succession! Byron,
however, in the last six lines of another poem&mdash;the
"Sonnet on Chillon"&mdash;has paid a stately
tribute to the actual Bonnivard, which will be
recalled with interest in the striking, half-subterranean
dungeon in which he was confined for
more than four years of his captivity:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Chillon! thy prison is a holy place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy sad floor an altar&mdash;for 'twas trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until his very steps have left a trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worn, as if the cold pavement were a sod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Bonnivard! May none those marks efface!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they appeal from tyranny to God."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">I do not know whether these footmarks are still
visible, or, indeed, were ever visible; but if we
choose to imagine them&mdash;Bonnivard was chained
to the fifth pillar from the entrance&mdash;we shall
not do much amiss. At least it would be better
thus to err on the side of imagination than to
imitate the English lady of whom Byron complained
when he visited Chillon, not for the first
time, on September 18, 1816, that he met her
on his return fast asleep in her carriage&mdash;"fast
asleep in the most anti-narcotic spot in the
world."</p>
